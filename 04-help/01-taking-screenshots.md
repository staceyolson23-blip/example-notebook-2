- Copy a Selected Portion of the Screen to the Clipboard: Press Command (‚åò) + Control (‚åÉ) + Shift + 4. This allows you to select a portion of the screen to capture, and it will be copied to the clipboard.
- Copy a Specific Window to the Clipboard: Press Command (‚åò) + Control (‚åÉ) + Shift + 4, then press the space bar. Move the camera icon over the window you want to capture, click, and the screenshot will be copied to the clipboard.
- All options: Press Command (‚åò) + Shift + 5 to open the screenshot toolbar, which gives you several options.
