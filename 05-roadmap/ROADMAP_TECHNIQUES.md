## Core Analytics Techniques

- [ ] **Descriptive statistics** - Mean, median, mode, standard deviation  
- [ ] **Data visualization and exploration** - Charts, graphs, and summary views  
- [ ] **Filtering, sorting, and slicing data** - Extract specific subsets for analysis  
- [ ] **Grouping and aggregation** - Summarize data by categories (e.g., SUM, AVG)  
- [ ] **Pivot tables, cross-tabulation, and summaries** - Reshape and summarize data  
- [ ] **Basic SQL Querying (SELECT, WHERE, JOIN)** - Retrieve and combine datasets

## Data Preparation Techniques

- [ ] **Data cleaning** - Handle typos, inconsistent values  
- [ ] **Handling missing values** - Fill, drop, or flag missing data  
- [ ] **Detecting and filtering outliers** - Identify and handle extreme values  
- [ ] **Deduplication** - Remove duplicate records  
- [ ] **Type conversion and data normalization** - Ensure consistency and accuracy  
- [ ] **Encoding categorical variables** - One-hot, label, or ordinal encoding  
- [ ] **Feature creation and transformation** - Generate new variables for analysis  
- [ ] **Merging and joining datasets** - Combine data from multiple sources  
- [ ] **Standardizing units and formats** - Align dates, currencies, etc.  
- [ ] **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT processes** - Move and prepare data for analysis

## Data Modeling & Warehousing  

- [ ] **Star and snowflake schema design** - Efficient storage and access patterns  
- [ ] **Fact and dimension table definitions** - Organize data for analysis  
- [ ] **Creating and populating a data warehouse** - Store and structure historical data  


---

## OLAP Processing  

- [ ] **Slicing** - Filters data along one dimension, creating a 2D view (e.g., sales for "Region A")  
- [ ] **Dicing** - Filters data along multiple dimensions, creating a sub-cube (e.g., sales for "Region A," "Electronics," "2023")  
- [ ] **Roll-up** - Aggregates data to a higher level (e.g., Daily ‚Üí Monthly or Store ‚Üí Region)  
- [ ] **Drill-down** - Expands data to a more detailed level (e.g., Year ‚Üí Quarter ‚Üí Month)  

---

## Warehouse Management

- [ ] **Designing efficient queries** - Optimize data retrieval  
- [ ] **Managing Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)** - Track historical changes over time  


---

## Business Intelligence & Reporting

- [ ] **Defining KPIs and metrics** - Key performance indicators and measurements  
- [ ] **Designing dashboards for clarity and impact** - Visual insights at a glance  
- [ ] **Building interactive reports** - Filters, slicers, and dynamic views  
- [ ] **Storytelling with data and visual narratives** - Communicate insights effectively  
- [ ] **Refreshing and automating reports** - Ensure data stays up-to-date  
- [ ] **Data blending** - Combine data from multiple sources  
- [ ] **User access control and data security** - Manage permissions and protection  


---

## Machine Learning & Prediction

- [ ] **Classification and regression basics** - Predict categories or numeric values  
- [ ] **Splitting data into training and test sets** - Prepare for evaluation  
- [ ] **Feature selection and feature engineering** - Improve model quality  
- [ ] **Evaluating models** - Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1  
- [ ] **Avoiding overfitting and using cross-validation** - Improve generalization  
- [ ] **Hyperparameter tuning** - Optimize model parameters  
- [ ] **Model deployment basics** - Make models accessible and usable  

---

## Applied Analytics

- [ ] **Web scraping and text mining (NLP)** - Extract data from web pages and analyze text  
- [ ] **Time series forecasting** - Predict future values over time  
- [ ] **Recommendation systems** - Suggest items based on user behavior  
- [ ] **Working with streaming data** - Real-time analysis of incoming data  
- [ ] **Real-time analytics with Kafka streams** - High-volume real-time processing  
- [ ] **Graph analytics** - Analyze relationships in networked data  

---

## Advanced & Emerging Techniques

- [ ] **Semantic search and embeddings** - Contextual search and vector representations  
- [ ] **Integrating AI/LLMs in workflows** - Enhance decision-making with AI  
- [ ] **Data orchestration (Prefect / Airflow)** - Automate and schedule data workflows
