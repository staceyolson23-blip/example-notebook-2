# üîµ Part 3: Repeatable Project Workflow

This section provides step-by-step instructions for working on an existing Python project. 
These steps are repeatable and should be followed whenever you make changes, update dependencies, or work on project features.

**IMPORTANT**: Complete all of Part 1: [üü¢ Set up the Machine](../01-machine-setup/MACHINE-SETUP.md) and Part 2: [üü† Initialize a Project](../02-project-initialization/PROJECT-INITIALIZATION.md) first, before continuing.

## When Working on The Project

Follow these steps when starting a new work session on a professional Python project.

1. **Pull** the Latest Changes from GitHub. 
   - [01-git-pull-before-changes.md](01-git-pull-before-changes.md)

2. **Activate** the Project Virtual Environment:
   - [02-activate-virtual-environment.md](02-activate-virtual-environment.md)

3. **Install** Dependencies As Needed:
   - [03-install-dependencies.md](03-install-dependencies.md)

4. **Run** Scripts and/or Jupyter notebooks. Choose one or both as needed:  
   - [04a-activate-and-run-python-script.md](04a-activate-and-run-python-script.md)  
   - [04b-activate-and-run-jupyter-notebook.md](04b-activate-and-run-jupyter-notebook.md)

5. **Modify** code and test functionality:
   - [05-modify-and-test.md](05-test-and-make-changes.md)

6. **Save** your work with git add-commit-push to GitHub: 
   - [06-git-add-commit-push.md](06-git-add-commit-push.md)


## Important

- Always pull the latest changes before starting to avoid merge conflicts.
- Test your project to ensure it works as expected before using git add-commit-push.
- Make frequent commits when enhancing a project.
