When working on a project always open that project repository folder in VS Code.
In general, all terminal commands should be executed in the **root project folder**.  
For example, when working in this project, all commands would be executed in the `pro-analytics-01` folder.

Use the VS Code menu to turn on autosave (File / Autosave), or remember to save your changes as you work.

Test your code and ensure it runs successfully. 
In general, do not git add-commit-push if the code doesn't run. 
Comment out content as needed to get a version that runs without errors before doing git add-commit-push.
If you encounter errors, use debugging tools or strategically placed print or logging statements to help identify issues.  

Use git add-commit-push frequently to commit small sets of well-labeled changes to the repository. 
A good commit history helps identify where things might have gone wrong (and when they got fixed).
