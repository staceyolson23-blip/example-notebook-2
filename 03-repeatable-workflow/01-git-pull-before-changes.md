Before making any changes to a project, ALWAYS pull the latest changes from the remote repository on GitHub. Keep both locations up-to-date and in sync. 

Pulling ensures that:
- You work with the latest code.
- Merge conflicts are minimized.
- Collaboration stays smooth.

## Before Starting

Open your project repository in VS Code. 

We'll open a new terminal in VS Code and run a single command. 

## Task 1. Pull Changes

Run the following command from the project root directory. 
The command works in PowerShell, bash, zsh, Git Bash, and more. 

```shell
git pull origin main
```

Once configured, you might find that a shorter version works as well: `git pull`

Review the output for updates or conflicts. 
If there are conflicts, resolve them before proceeding.
The best solution to merge conflicts is to AVOID them through a good workflow.
