ALWAYS activate the .venv before working on the project.Activate whenever you open a new terminal. 

## Before Starting

Open your project repository in VS Code. 

We'll open a new terminal in VS Code and run a single command. 

## Windows Machines: Task 1. Activate

Run the following command from the project root directory. 
The command works in PowerShell.

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Mac/Linux Machines: Task 1. Activate

Run the following command from the project root directory. 
The command works in zsh, bash, and more.

```powershell
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Verify
Confirm activation by checking that the terminal shows the environment name (e.g., (venv)).

## Recommendation

This command is a bit harder to memorize. Use the UP ARROW key to access prior commands in the terminal and keep good notes in your README.md files.
