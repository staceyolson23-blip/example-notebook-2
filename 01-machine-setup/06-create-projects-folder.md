## Windows Users
For Windows machines with OneDrive enabled, the `Documents` folder is NOT ideal for our GitHub projects. 
OneDrive's automatic syncing slows things down when working with large Python projects and is not needed - we back up our work in GitHub. 

We recommend creating a dedicated folder outside of OneDrive's sync scope, for example, a folder named `Repos` (short for *repositories*) in the root of your C: drive (i.e. `C:\Repos`, directions below).

### Windows Task 1. Create `C:\Repos` Directory

1. Open File Explorer.
2. Navigate to `C:\`.
3. Create a new folder named `Repos`.

Important

- Capitalize the "R" in Repos as programming is case-sensitive. 
- Verify the folder is directly in C:\ (`C:\Repos`), not inside another folder such as Documents or Desktop.
- Optional: Ensure the new directory is NOT being backed up by OneDrive or other sync services. Check OneDrive settings.

## Mac/Linux Users
Keep your projects outside any cloud-sync folders like iCloud's Desktop or Documents.
This ensures smoother performance and avoids syncing unnecessary temporary files from your GitHub Python projects.

We recommend creating a dedicated folder outside of OneDrive's sync scope, for example, a folder named `Repos` (short for *repositories*) (i.e. `~/Repos`, directions below).

### Mac/Linux Task 1. Create `~/Repos` Directory

1. Click the Finder icon in your Dock to open a new Finder window.
2. Access Your Home Directory: In the Finder menu bar at the top of your screen, click Go, then select Home. Alternatively, press Command + Shift + H to open your Home folder.
3. Right-click (or Control-click) in the Home folder and select New Folder. Name the folder Repos.

Important

- Capitalize the "R" in Repos as programming is case-sensitive. 
- Verify the folder is directly in your Home folder (~/Repos), not inside another folder like Documents or Desktop.
- Optional: Ensure this folder is NOT being backed up by iCloud if you have iCloud syncing enabled for your Desktop or Documents. To check: Go to System Settings > Apple ID > iCloud > iCloud Drive > Options and ensure "Desktop & Documents Folders" is unchecked.
