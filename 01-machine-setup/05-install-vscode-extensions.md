This page provides instructions to install common Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions for Python development.

## Open VS Code

Open your VS Code editor. We'll use the built-in Extensions Marketplace to install extensions.

## Access the Extensions Marketplace

Use the VS Code menu to navigate to View / Extensions (or press Ctrl+Shift+X on Windows or Cmd+Shift+X on Mac). This will open the Extensions panel.

## Install the Following Extensions

Search for and install the following extensions in the Extensions panel.

1. Install Core Extensions:
    - Python (by Microsoft): Language support, linting, debugging
    - Jupyter (by Microsoft): Run and edit Jupyter Notebooks
    - Pylance (by Microsoft): Fast type checking and IntelliSense

2. Add Notebook-Specific Support (Optional):
    - Jupyter Keymap (by Microsoft): Jupyter-style shortcuts in VS Code
    - Jupyter Notebook Renderers (by Microsoft): Improved cell output formatting

3. Set Up Code Formatting and Style:
    - Prettier (by Prettier) â€“ Code formatting for Python, markdown, and more
    - Markdown All in One (by Yu Zhang) â€“ Formatting and live preview for markdown files
    - Rainbow CSV (by mechatroner) - formatting comma-separated values by color

4. Work with SQLite databases in VS Code:
    - SQLite Viewer (by Florian Klampfer) â€“ Lightweight extension for opening and editing `.db` files directly in VS Code. Supports running queries and viewing tables.
    - SQLite (by alexcvzz) â€“ Full-featured SQLite extension with query support, table management, and data visualization.

## Verify Installation

After installing, restart VS Code and verify that the extensions appear in the Extensions panel.

## Notes

- Extensions are updated regularly, so ensure they are kept up to date.
- Additional extensions may be helpful depending on the project.
- When VS Code recommends an extension, it is usually a good idea to try it.
