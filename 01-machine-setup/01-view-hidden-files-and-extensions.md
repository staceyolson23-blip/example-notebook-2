## File Extensions
**File extensions** are suffixes added to the end of a file name, typically consisting of a period (dot) followed by a few characters.
File extensions indicate the file's format or type, helping both users and software identify the file's purpose and compatibility. 
Common file extensions include:

- `.py` (Python files)
- `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook files)
- `.csv` (Comma-separated value files)
- `.md` (Markdown files)
 
Understanding file extensions is essential for identifying file types. 
New Python developers may omit file extensions, or not see them, or get them incorrect. 
File extensions are critical. 
You must have correct file extensions for your projects to be effectively published and shared.  

## Hidden Files and Folders
Certain files and folders are typically hidden from the user to prevent accidental modification or deletion. 
These hidden files often contain system configurations and settings.
In data analytics projects, we use files that our operating system may try to hide and as developers we need to see these. 

## Task 1. Enable View Settings 

On Mac/Linux:

1. Open your file manager (e.g., Finder on Mac).
2. Enable viewing hidden files and folders

    - Mac: Press `Cmd Shift .` in Finder to toggle hidden files. (That is, hold all three `Cmd` and `Shift` and `.` (dot) keys down together.)
    - Linux: Use your file manager settings to show hidden files.

3. Enable viewing file extensions:
    - Mac: In Finder, go to menu Finder > Settings > Advanced and check "Show all filename extensions."
    - Linux: Use your file manager settings to show file extensions.

**Verify** by finding a folder with files that have file extensions (e.g., a README.md file). 

On Windows:

1. Open **File Explorer**.
2. Click the **View** tab on the ribbon.
3. In the **Show/Hide** group, check:
    - File name extensions.
    - Hidden items.
